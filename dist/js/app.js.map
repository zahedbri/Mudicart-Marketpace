Can be called without `new`.\n *\n * ##### presetName\n *\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\n *\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {};\n      presetName = 'default';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].

The lexer (found in Lexer.js, stored at\n * this.lexer) also supports pulling out tokens at arbitrary places. When\n * individual tokens are needed at a position, the lexer is called to pull out a\n * token, which is then used.\n *\n * The parser has a property called \"mode\" indicating the mode that\n * the parser is currently in. Currently it has to be one of \"math\" or\n * \"text\", which denotes whether the current environment is a math-y\n * one or a text-y one (e.g. inside \\text). Currently, this serves to\n * limit the functions which can be used in text mode.\n *\n * The main functions then return an object which contains the useful data that\n * was parsed at its given point, and a new position at the end of the parsed\n * data. The main functions can call each other and continue the parsing by\n * using the returned position as a new starting point.\n *\n * There are also extra `.handle...` functions, which pull out some reused\n * functionality into self-contained functions.\n *\n * The earlier functions return ParseNodes.\n * The later functions (which are called deeper in the parse) sometimes return\n * ParseFuncOrArgument, which contain a ParseNode as well as some data about\n * whether the parsed object is a function which is missing some arguments, or a\n * standalone object which can be used as an argument to another function.\n */\n\n/**\n * Main Parser class\n */\nfunction Parser(input, settings) {\n    // Make a new lexer\n    this.lexer = new Lexer(input);\n    // Store the settings for use in parsing\n    this.settings = settings;\n}\n\nvar ParseNode = parseData.ParseNode;\n\n/**\n * An initial function (without its arguments), or an argument to a function.\n * The `result` argument should be a ParseNode.\n */\nfunction ParseFuncOrArgument(result, isFunction) {\n    this.result = result;\n    // Is this a function (i.e. is it something defined in functions.js)?\n    this.isFunction = isFunction;\n}\n\n/**\n * Checks a result to make sure it has the right type, and throws an\n * appropriate error otherwise.\n *\n * @param {boolean=} consume whether to consume the expected token,\n *                           defaults to true\n */\nParser.prototype.expect = function(text, consume) {\n    if (this.nextToken.text !== text) {\n        throw new ParseError(\n            \"Expected '\" + text + \"', got '\" + this.nextToken.text + \"'\",\n            this.lexer, this.nextToken.position\n        );\n    }\n    if (consume !== false) {\n        this.consume();\n    }\n};\n\n/**\n * Considers the current look ahead token as consumed,\n * and fetches the one after that as the new look ahead.\n */\nParser.prototype.consume = function() {\n    this.pos = this.nextToken.position;\n    this.nextToken = this.lexer.lex(this.pos, this.mode);\n};\n\n/**\n * Main parsing function, which parses an entire input.\n *\n * @return {?Array.<ParseNode>}\n */\nParser.prototype.parse = function() {\n    // Try to parse the input\n    this.mode = \"math\";\n    this.pos = 0;\n    this.nextToken = this.lexer.lex(this.pos, this.mode);\n    var parse = this.parseInput();\n    return parse;\n};\n\n/**\n * Parses an entire input tree.\n */\nParser.prototype.parseInput = function() {\n    // Parse an expression\n    var expression = this.parseExpression(false);\n    // If we succeeded, make sure there's an EOF at the end\n    this.expect(\"EOF\", false);\n    return expression;\n};\n\nvar endOfExpression = [\"}\", \"\\\\end\", \"\\\\right\", \"&\", \"\\\\\\\\\", \"\\\\cr\"];\n\n/**\n * Parses an \"expression\", which is a list of atoms.\n *\n * @param {boolean} breakOnInfix Should the parsing stop when we hit infix\n *                  nodes?
